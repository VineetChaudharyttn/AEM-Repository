Question 5: Define a component in such a way that content remains same on all pages created using a common template and the authored content can be reused on other templates as well without any re-authoring of the content.

Answer:  Create a template and add any component to that template. Now Move that template into the Template type and create any template using that template type.
Then the component that we have added to the template which is moved to template type will be available in all the templates created from that template type.
